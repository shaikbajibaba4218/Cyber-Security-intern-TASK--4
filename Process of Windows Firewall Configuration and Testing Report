Windows Firewall Configuration and Testing Report

Step 1: Open Firewall Configuration Tool
On Windows, open the Control Panel → System and Security → Windows Defender Firewall →Advanced settings. 
This opens the 'Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security' tool, whereinbound and outbound rules can be configured.


Step 2: List Current Firewall Rules
In the left panel, click on 'Inbound Rules' or 'Outbound Rules' to see all existing firewall rules. 
You can check which applications or ports are allowed or blocked.


Step 3: Add Rule to Block a Specific Port (Example: 23 - Telnet)
Click 'Inbound Rules' → 'New Rule' → Select 'Port' → Choose TCP → Enter port number 23 →Select 'Block the connection' → Apply to all profiles → Give it a name like 'Block Telnet'.
This will prevent any incoming Telnet traffic on port 23.


Step 4: Test the Rule
Try connecting to port 23 locally or from another computer using 'telnet 23'. If the rule is active, 
the connection should fail.


Step 5: Allow SSH (Port 22)
If SSH is needed, create a new inbound rule for port 22 (TCP) and select 'Allow the connection'.
This is useful if running an OpenSSH server on Windows.


Step 6: Remove the Test Block Rule
Go back to 'Inbound Rules', find the 'Block Telnet' rule, right-click, and choose 'Delete' or 'Disable'
to restore the original state.

Step 8: Summary – How Firewall Filters Traffic
A firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.
Inbound rules control what can come into your computer, and outbound rules control what can
leave it. By setting these rules, administrators can block dangerous services (e.g., Telnet) and allow
necessary ones (e.g., SSH).
